**Wireframe**

Before creating your website, it's always a good idea to plan out how your website is going to be structured and how it's going to be presentable to your audience. The 3 main
components of your website should be header, main (body), and footer.

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**

HTML is a coding language used to give structure to you website. Below is an example of a complete html code. 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<title>HTML Tutorial</title>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

**Creating Repository**
You have to create a new repository on github but instead of the files being .md, they would be .html.


**Deploying**

To deploy your website after you've typed your html on VS Code, you can either push it back up to github where you created your repository, or do a live-server command
on the terminal like live-server index.html..
