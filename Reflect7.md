**How Computers Work**

Take input>Store>Process>Output = What makes a computer, a computer.

- Computers started out as calculators. Modern computers look very different and work differently than older computers but they still
do the same 4 basic functions of input, store, process and output.

- Information is taken in, stored and processed as data, and output as results.

- Inside a computer are wires and circuits carrying data as electricity. It starts with on/off and gets translater into 1/0 bits in the
binary number system. The binary system is multiplied by 2. The more wires a computer has, the bigger the numbers it can store. 

- Every input or output is a type of information that can be represented by on or off electrical signals (1 or 0) binary code. This is what forms a 
circuit. The circuit that you put in is different from the one coming out. If you put in a 0, then the circuit will give you a 1. 

- Smaller computers can be faster because it the electrical signal doesn't need to travel too far. The circuits would be much closer
within a smaller computer, thus the travel time would be less for the signal to travel.

- Computer takes information from outside and coverts it into binary information. It then stores and process the information before
outputting a display or render what you told to computer to display, whether it be text, image and/or sounds.

- Modern computers often have multiple CPUs with more storage in order to store and process multiple information and outputting it back into the 
physical world.
