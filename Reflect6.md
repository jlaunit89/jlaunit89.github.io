*How HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER**

- These 3 languages used together can create a functioning website. HTML is the base language that shows the raw data on your website,
CSS is used to style your website and give structure to how it looks, and /Javascript/ gives functionality to your website.

- It's always a good practice to keep the three /languages/ on separate files. Link your CSS and JS files to your /HTML/ file to 
get full functionality on your website. Adding all the different codes together can be confusing and extremely difficult to make
changes or corrections later down the line.

- Progressive Enhancement: Build your web page with an open mind knowing that you are going to have to improve the web page
throughout it's life.

- Keeping CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content (HTML) itself. Javascript is added last to 
give functionality to the site and enhance it's capabilities.

- Note: Internet Explorer sometimes prevents JS from running when opening a page stored locally. If this happens, try another web browser
like chrome, etc.

- It's usually a good practice to put the script right before the closing body script. Another good practice is to put </script/> in their own files.

- A simple way to write content into the web page is by using document.write(), although it isn't always the best way. Example, document.write('Good Morning!');

- Javascript is a text file with a .js extension. This is what makes it different from HTML and CSS.

- The HTML script tells the browser to load a javascript file, just like the link element is used to load a CSS file.

- Script: A series of instructions, or statements that the computer can follow. It can only follow one statement at a time. Each statement starts
on a new line in your code.

- Another good practice is to write comments to explain what each code does. Example, /*This script displays a greeting to the user based on the current time.
It is an example from reading book*/

- Variables: A variable is used to temporarily store a script or instruction for the computer to follow. It is temporary because once you leave the page, the 
browser will forget what instructions are in the variable. The script inside a variable can also change each time a script runs.

- Declaring a variable: example, var quantity; This announces your intention to use a variable. In this example, var is the keyword to start the variable and 
quantity is the name or identifier of your variable. Once you've created your variable, you can assign it a value. For example, quantity=5;. The value will be
undefined if you don't assign the identifier a value.
