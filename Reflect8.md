**Notes from 12/15/2020**

- Functions should function declarations should be at the top of the page. 
- Script is best to be located towards the bottom of the page.
- Always a good practice to add comments to your js page to describe what the functions are supposed to do,
or to state parameters and requirements. Comments should start with / or //for scripts.
- Wrapper function - Includes website in comments for reference only (no functionality).

**Loops**

- Loops check a condition. The loop will run the code continuously and will ask if you want it to stop.
- A FOR loop will run a loop a certain (known) amount of times. This is the most common loop.
- WHILE loop runs continue to loop as long as the condition is true. This is used when you don't know how many times the loop should run.
- FOR loops variables are commonly named with a single letter.
- i++ is an incrementer adding more value to the variable.
- document.write starts(i) the code. ex., for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                                                document.write(i);
                                           }
loops are used 
- !== is a negation operator, as opposed to === which is a true operator.
